R script used to analyze data and produce figures and tables presented in the article:

Volchenkov R, Nygaard V, Sener Z, Sk√•lhegg BS. [Th17 Polarization under Hypoxia
Results in Increased IL-10 Production in a Pathogen-Independent Manner](https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00698). Front
Immunol. 2017 Jun 19;8:698. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.00698. eCollection 2017.
PubMed PMID: 28674533; PubMed Central PMCID: PMC5474482.
